# Lancashire fracking: MP calls for process to cease after tremors

In August 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-49485125) on the occurrence of tremors after they led to operations being suspended at the only active shale gas site in the UK.

We used data from the British Geological Survey, which [records seismic events induced by human activities](http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/induced/recent_uk_events.html).

And we annotated our chart to explain how events with a magnitude below zero are very small while those above 2.0 can be felt by people on the surface.
